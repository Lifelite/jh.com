                        Everything seen on this web, I built from scratch. Wanted a professional looking website
                        to showcase my skills, learn while doing, and experiment ideas. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        What is a Quality Engineer doing building websites? I&#39;m a firm believer that you&#39;re
                        only truly able to test something as much as you understand it, otherwise it&#39;s just educated
                        UAT.
                        <br/>
                        I also very much enjoy it. It&#39;s something I do as a hobby and maybe something I&#39;ll
                        choose to do
                        for my career someday. I like to keep an open path, because one never knows where life will take
                        you!

                        This is my work in progress Automation framework using Python with Playwright.
                        It started as a learning project and I ended up using it for a variety of uses, but
                        it needs to be updated as this was one of those &#34;POCs that turned into tech debt&#34;

                        This was a fun weekend project using Python and Discord.gg&#39;s API to build a simple character
                        battle game for my friends in my discord server. It utilizes their API along with a cloud MySQL
                        database allow users to create, edit, and delete their characters; as well as allowing them to
                        start a battle that pits all the characters against each other in a tournament style battle.

                        Created this website for my gaming community. This was a rushed job to get it out the door for
                        our annual secret Santa Event, but it&#39;s fully functional and was used during the event to
                        great
                        success! <br/>
                        The website utilizes Auth, MySQL, Cloud Functions, Dashboards, and more.
